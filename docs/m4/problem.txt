Since we have reconfigured the listeners in the first module to use localhost as address for external clients
and no longer use the mapping of broker-n to localhost in /etc/hosts, we now get the familiar SSL handshake
exception when running the BasicSSL clients:
Exception in thread "main" org.apache.kafka.common.errors.SslAuthenticationException: SSL handshake failed
Caused by: javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: No name matching localhost found

This can be fixed by adding SubjectAlternativeName entries during keypair generation:
adding  -ext SAN=dns:localhost as argument to the keytool -genkeypair commands for all brokers.

This is very time-consuming as we have to redo all the work for constructing the 3 broker-n.keystore.jks files.
We will do this another time and then retest BasicSSLConsumer and BasicSSLProducer.

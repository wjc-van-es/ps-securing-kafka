PluralSight Course: Securing a kafka Cluser by Bogdan Sucaciu

---
## WARNING
This Git repository contains artefacts you would normally **never** store in a Git repository for any real 
application deployed in a production environment, 
as these must be kept secret and secure:
- keystores
- truststores
- private keys

The reason they are included is that this is a tutorial, and otherwise it would be very difficult
to follow the steps of the course.

All these artefacts can be found in [security](security).

This was not mentioned in the video, but in the docker-compose-sasl-plain.yaml file the entry
          KAFKA_SSL_CLIENT_AUTH
          was changed from required to none
(compared to the docker-compose-mtls.yaml  file)
I wanted to check if it should be required, because some slight oversights kept appearing in the demo's.
I left it on required and it worked fine. I am still not sure how this needs to be set, but it seems to be working either way.

In Both the SASLPlainConsumer & the SASLPlainProducer we need to set a VM option, which is a bit hidden from the Run Configuration
window. (It's neither an Application argument nor an environment variable, which both are visible options by default)
Click on the Link Modify Options (ALT+M) and Add Add VM Options (ALT+V)
and then you may add to the producer and the consumer config respectively:
-Djava.security.auth.login.config=/home/willem/git/ps-securing-kafka/secure-clients/src/main/resources/sasl_plain_producer_jaas.conf
-Djava.security.auth.login.config=/home/willem/git/ps-securing-kafka/secure-clients/src/main/resources/sasl_plain_consumer_jaas.conf

As an extra reminder of this special VM option setting to the java command I selected "Store as Project file" for both
the run configurations. They are stored as:
.run/SASLPlainConsumer.run.xml and .run/SASLPlainProducer.run.xml
